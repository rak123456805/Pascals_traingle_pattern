# Pascal's Triangle Pattern in C++

This is a simple C++ program that prints **Pascal's Triangle** for a given number of rows.  
It demonstrates nested loops, binomial coefficient calculation, and pattern printing with proper alignment.

## ðŸ“Œ What is Pascal's Triangle?
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular arrangement of numbers where:
- The first and last number of each row is always `1`.
- Any other number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
- It also represents binomial coefficients.

Example for 5 rows:
        1
      1   1
    1   2   1
  1   3   3   1
1   4   6   4   1
Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it:
Value = (above-left) + (above-right)
